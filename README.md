Code from Algorithms for Decision Making Spring 2022 St. Olaf College

### Challenge1-mnist-feature

This folder hosts code from the first 'Challenge' from the class. Myself and a couple other students were given two digits (2 and 3) and had to come up with features that would allow us to classify images between these digits using pixel information. Using these features, we then used various modeling techniques such as LDA (linear discriminant analysis) and QDA (quadratic discriminant analysis). 

The final report that we developed for this project can be found in `combined-approach-copy.pdf`. 


### Submit

This folder contains homework assignments and other in-class files that were used throughout the course.
